However, it's not clear where the password is being set or how it's being stored in the database.\n\n4. **Separation of concerns**: The `UserDetailsServiceImpl` class is responsible for both loading user details and creating the `UserDetails` object. It might be better to separate these concerns into two different classes or methods.\n\n5. **Dependency injection**: The `CustomerRepository` and `StaffRepository` dependencies are injected using the `@Autowired` annotation, which is a good practice. However, it might be worth considering using constructor injection instead, as it can make the class more testable and maintainable.\n\nOverall, the code is well-written and follows best practices for implementing the `UserDetailsService` interface. With a few minor improvements, it could be even more robust and maintainable.",

It might be better to handle the case where the customer is not found.\n   - The method creates a new `Order` object for each rental, which could potentially lead to performance issues if the customer has a large number of rentals. It might be more efficient to use a data structure that can efficiently store and retrieve the rental information.\n3. Suggestions:\n   - Consider adding error handling and input validation to the method to ensure that the provided customer ID is valid and within the expected range.\n   - Explore the possibility of optimizing the method's performance by reducing the number of database queries or by using a more efficient data structure to store the rental information.\n   - Consider adding unit tests to ensure the method's correctness and to facilitate future maintenance and refactoring."
